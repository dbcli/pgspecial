Meta-commands for Postgres
--------------------------

|BuildStatus|  |PyPI|

This package provides an API to execute meta-commands (AKA "special", or
"backslash commands") on PostgreSQL.

Quick Start
-----------

This is a python package. It can be installed with:

::

    $ pip install pgspecial


Usage
-----

Once this library is included into your project, you will most likely use the
following imports:

.. code-block:: python

    from pgspecial.main import PGSpecial
    from pgspecial.namedqueries import NamedQueries
    from psycopg2.extensions import cursor

Then you will create and use an instance of PGSpecial:

.. code-block:: python

        pgspecial = PGSpecial()
        for result in pgspecial.execute(cur: cursor, sql):
            # Do something

If you want to import named queries from an existing config file, it is
convenient to initialize and keep around the class variable in
``NamedQueries``:

.. code-block:: python

    from configobj import ConfigObj

    NamedQueries.instance = NamedQueries.from_config(
        ConfigObj('~/.config_file_name'))

to extend my heartfelt gratitude. I've written a small doc to describe how to
get this running in a development setup.
